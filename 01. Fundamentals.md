# React Fundamentals

#### https://github.com/john-smilga/react-course-v3

## Introduction

ReactJS is a JavaScript Library that is used for building user-interfaces.

Consists of "Components". Components are independent chunks of user-interfaces.

ReactJS Official Documentation - https://legacy.reactjs.org/

#### Advantages

- A bunch of independent, isolated & re-usable user-interfaces that can be combined together easily!

- Changes can be propagated easily by changing the component only!

- React uses Virtual-DOM, which makes sure that only the component that needs to be updated is affected. Therefore, the whole app is not re-rendered which leads to increased developement speeds!
 
#### Note

- The Project consists of atleast one element: the ROOT element.

- The Project proceeds by building the general-structure of the components, and then the data is passed into these components.

- **Terminal/Command-Prompt:** An alternative way to communicate with our computer using various commands.

#### NodeJS

- A Cross-Platform JavaScript Runtime Environment, which is used to build fast & scalable network-applications.

- We will require NodeJS to create our React-App instance, as well as run it!

- Official Website - https://nodejs.org/en

## Setup

Official Website - https://react.dev/

We need to setup a few things to start working-off in React.

- For this, we will utilise the Package: **create-react-app**. This package is developed/updated by Facebook which ensures credibility.

- This Package helps us to initiate our React-Application easily, thus, helping us to avoid complex config-setups/build-tools.

- NodeJS also inclues **npm (Node Package Manager)**, which helps us quickly install external-packages.
  
- **Install an external-package:**
  - npm install packageName

  - npmi packageName

- **Create a new React-Application instance:**
  - npx create-react-app app-name
  - npx create-react-app@latest app-name

  - npx is used to execute the create-react-app package, rather than installing it on our machine.

- **Run the React-Application:**
  - npm start

  - npm is used to start the development-server on our machine.
  - Everytime there is a change in the code, the development-server automatically updates the browser.

## Folder Structure

- **node_modules:** Contains all the dependencies that the project is utilising.

- **public:** Contains static-assets including "index.html", which is responsible for what you see on the browser.

  - The logic/functionality of the application is set-up inside the "src" folder, and it is injected from the "src" into the id="root" element, which then renders the React-Application as a whole in our browser.

  - **index.html**
    - title
    - fonts
    - css
    - favicon
    - id="root" - our entire React-Application lives inside this root-element.

- **src:** In simple terms - it is the "brain" of our app. 

  - This is where we will do all of our work, set all components, functions, utlities, pages, css, assets, etc.

  - No restriction on the folder-structure inside the "src", as long as index.js is present.

  - src/index.js is the JavaScript entry point.

- **.gitignore:** It is used to specify which files source control(Git) should ignore.

- **package.json:** Every Node.js(not only React) project has a package.json file, which contains information about the project.

  - Primarily focused on 2 things - Scripts & Dependencies!

    - **Scripts:** Lists the commands that we can execute in our project.

      - npm start

      - npm run build

      - npm run commandName

    - **Dependencies:** Lists the "main" Dependencies/Libraries are present that are being used in the project. These "main" dependencies further have their own dependencies which are present inside the node_modules folder as discussed earlier.

      - Dependencies has its own Dependencies.

      - Therefore, it is advisable to not push node_modules to github because of its large size.

      - Instead, we can specify the dependencies/libraries being used inside package.json.

      - Then, we can simply use *npm install* to install the required dependencies.

- **package-lock.json:** A snapshot of the entire dependency-tree.

- **README.md:** The markdown-file where we can share more information about the project such as build-instructions.

## First Component

- In order to create a component in React, we need to create a JavaScript Function!

- When you think of a component, think of a function!

#### Code

```js
function Greeting() {
  return <h2>My First Component</h2>;
}

// arrow function also works

const Greeting = () => {
  return <h2>My First Component</h2>;
};
```

- **Rules while writing a function for a component:**

  - Starts with a capital-letter.

  - Function must ALWAYS return JSX or HTML.

  - You must ALWAYS close the tag `<Greeting />`.

#### Typical Component

- Firstly, create the function/component.

- Secondly, export the function/component.

- ES6 modules will be covered later in the course.

- Exporting the component helps us to use the exported-component anywhere inside our application.

#### Code

```js
const Greeting = () => {
  return <h2>My First Component</h2>;
};
export default Greeting;
```

#### Root Component

- The root-component is set up inside src/index.js.

- An application can contain thousands of components, but won't work without the root-component.

- We will inject the root-component inside the id="root" element to implement our React-Application.

- Exporting the component helps us to use the exported-component anywhere inside our application.

#### Code

**index.js**

```js
import React from 'react';                  // grab React from 'react' package!
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom/client';    // grab ReactDOM 'react-dom/client' package!

function Greeting() {
  return <h2>My First Component</h2>;
}

const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root'));
// createRoot method creates the root-component, getElementById is used to find element with id="root" inside index.html;

root.render(<Greeting />);                  // render the function/component!
```

- The above code is special to only the root-component, inside src/index.js.

- Always need to self-close tags in React.

## Extensions & Settings.json

- **Auto Rename Tag**

- **Prettier: Code Formatter**
  - Format on Save
  - Format on Paste
  - Default Formatter - Set as Prettier
  - We can write commands/rules in settings.json as an alternative to change the settings.

- **Emmet Abbreviations**
  - By default, disabled for React.
  - Syntax: h2#idname.classname

- **ES7+ React/Redux Snippets**
  - Everytime we need a new component, we will create a new file.
  - This is because the components can become huge in size.

  - This extension will set-up the component based on the name of the file. 
  - No need to import React with every component with the new syntax.
  - Disable: Settings: Import React On Top
  
  - rafce - Arrow Function with Export
  - rfce - Regular Function with Export

## First Component in Detail

- Starts with a capital-letter.

- Function must ALWAYS return JSX or HTML.

- You must ALWAYS close the tag `<Greeting />`.

- JSX makes it easier to code, it calls createElement() method under the hood!

#### Example

```js
// component/function using JSX Syntax
function Greeting() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h2>hello world</h2>
    </div>
  );
}

// component/function using createElement() method
const Greeting = () => {
  return React.createElement(
    'div',
    {},
    React.createElement('h2', {}, 'hello world')
  );
};
```

*It is clear from the above example, that JSX is easier to code with.*

### JSX Rules

- MUST return a SINGLE parent element.

- Preferable to use semantic elements.

- If you do not prefer `<div>` or semantic elements, use Fragments!

- **Fragments**: Allows to group elements, without adding extra nodes/elements.

#### Example

```js
return (
  <React.Fragment>
    <h3>Hello People!</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <a href="#">Hello World</a>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </React.Fragment>
);

// shorthand

return (
  <>
    <h3>Hello People!</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <a href="#">Hello World</a>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </>
);
```

### Property Naming Convention: camelCase

#### Example

```js
// ReactJS Syntax
return (
  <div tabIndex={1}>
    <button onClick={myFunction}>click me</button>
    <label htmlFor='name'>Name</label>
    <input readOnly={true} id='name' />
  </div>
)

// HTML Syntax
<div tabindex="1">
    <button onclick="myFunction()">click me</button>
    <label for='name'>Name</label>
    <input readonly id='name' />
</div>
```

*The attributes for HTML tags have a 'camelCase' naming convention in JSX Syntax.*

- **className** instead of class attribute!

#### Example

```js
return <div className='someValue'>hello</div>
```

- MUST **self-close** every tag, or React will throw an error!

#### Example

```js
return <img />;
return <input />;
```

- **Formatting**

  - Opening tag can be in the same line as return.

  - If not on the same line, need to use paranthesis - return();

## Arrow Functions

```js
// Normal Functions

function sum(x, y) {
    return x + y;
}
console.log(sum(2, 2));

const sum = function(x, y) {
    return x + y;
}
console.log(sum(2, 2));

// Arrow Functions - allow us to write shorter function syntax!

const sum = (x, y) => {
    return x + y;
}
console.log(sum(2, 2));

// if your function has only one statement, you can skip {} and return keyword!

const sum = (x, y) => x + y;
console.log(sum(2, 2));

// if you have only one parameter, you can skip the () parentheses!

const sum = (x) => x;
console.log(sum(2));
```

## Nested Components

```js
function Greeting() {
  return (
    <div>
      <Person />
      <Message />
    </div>
  );
}

const Person = () => <h2>john doe</h2>;
const Message = () => {
  return <p>this is my message</p>;
};
```

*Render the Person component, Message component inside Greeting component.*

- We can nest infinitely many components inside other components.

- So, we have a single root-component, conventionally called 'App'!

- And, we nest the rest of components inside of this root-component.

- Inject the root-component into `<div id='root'>`, and the root-component consists of other nested components.

## Book List Project

### Intial Setup!

#### Code

```js
import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom/client';

function BookList() {
  return (
    <section>
      <Book />
      <Book />
      <Book />
      <Book />
    </section>
  );
}

const Book = () => {
  return (
    <article>
      <Image />
      <Title />
      <Author />
    </article>
  );
};

const Image = () => <h2>image placeholder</h2>;
const Title = () => {
  return <h2>Book Title</h2>;
};
const Author = () => <h4>Author</h4>;

const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root'));

root.render(<BookList />);
```

- Reference Site: https://www.amazon.com/Best-Sellers-Books/zgbs/books/

- Choose a book, copy the image, title & author.

#### Code

```js
import React from "react";
import ReactDOM from "react-dom/client";

function BookList() {
    return (
        <section>
            <Book />
            <Book />
            <Book />
            <Book />
        </section>
    );
}

const Book = () => {
    return (
        <article>
            <Image />
            <Title />
            <Author />
        </article>
    );
};

const Image = () => (
    <img
        src='https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71m+Qtq+HrL._AC_UL900_SR900,600_.jpg'
        alt='Interesting Facts For Curious Minds'
    />
);
const Title = () => {
    return <h2>Interesting Facts For Curious Minds</h2>;
};
const Author = () => <h4>Jordan Moore</h4>;

const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById("root"));

root.render(<BookList />);
```

### CSS

- Create index.css in "src" folder.

- Import the file into our project!

#### index.css

```css
* {
  margin: 0;
  padding: 0;
  box-sizing: border-box;
}

body {
  font-family: system-ui, -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto,
    Oxygen, Ubuntu, Cantarell, 'Open Sans', 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif;
  background: #f1f5f8;
  color: #222;
}
```

- Don't need to provide the "Path" with libraries, just the library name.

- Need to specify the "Path" & the "Extension" for our own assets like css.

- Always going to start with a ' . ' which means we are looking in the same folder.

- *Syntax - import "./index.css";*

#### Add Classes & Import index.css!

```js
import './index.css';

function BookList() {
  return (
    <section className='booklist'>
      <Book />
      <Book />
      <Book />
      <Book />
    </section>
  );
}

const Book = () => {
  return (
    <article className='book'>
      <Image />
      <Title />
      <Author />
    </article>
  );
};
```

#### Complete the CSS!

```css
.booklist {
    width: 90vw;
    max-width: 1170px;
    margin: 5rem auto;
    display: grid;
    gap: 2rem;
}

@media screen and (min-width: 768px) {
    .booklist {
        grid-template-columns: repeat(3, 1fr);
    }
}

.book {
    background: #fff;
    border-radius: 1rem;
    padding: 2rem;
    text-align: center;
}

.book img {
    width: 100%;
    object-fit: cover;
}

.book h2 {
    margin-top: 1rem;
    font-size: 1rem;
}
```

### Images

- External Images (hosted on different server) - can access using a URL.

- Local Images (public folder) - less performant, not optimized.

- Local Images (src folder) - better solution for assets, since under the hood they get optimized.

#### Example

- Create images folder in public, and add the image.

- Replace the url in the src to './images/imageName.extension'

- Whatever assets we place in public, are instantly available to the project!

```js
const Image = () => (
  <img src='./images/book-1.jpg' alt='Interesting Facts For Curious Minds' />
);
```

### CSS Inside JSX

- An example of Inline-Styling.

- Implemented with the "style" attribute.

- Set the style attribute equal to the curly braces.

- CSS Properties with hyphen are replaced by camelCase convention.

- { } in JSX means we are going back to the JavaScript Land.

- Provide a JavaScript Object inside the curly braces.

#### Code

```js
const Author = () => (
  <h4 style={{ color: '#617d98', fontSize: '0.75rem', marginTop: '0.5rem' }}>
    Jordan Moore
  </h4>
);
```

- External Libraries use inline-css, so if you want to make some changes, reference the library-documentation.

- Alternatively, we can pass the reference to a JavaScript Object, instead of directly passing the values.

#### Code

```js
const Author = () => {
  const inlineHeadingStyles = {   // javascript object!
    color: '#617d98',
    fontSize: '0.75rem',
    marginTop: '0.5rem',
  };
  
  return <h4 style={inlineHeadingStyles}>Jordan Moore </h4>;    // reference the object!
};
```
