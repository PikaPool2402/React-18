# BackRoads Project

## Standard React Setup

-   "App" component is the root component, that contains all the other components.
-   Similar to "BookList" component in the BookList Project.
-   React StrictMode activates additional checks & warnings for its descendants.
-   In this mode, the application runs twice.
-   However, it is not going to affect the production.
-   We can split CSS into different files, but in the end it gets piled up into one file only.
-   Therefore, we need to be careful while setting up multiple CSS files, as the files are not scoped to the component only.
